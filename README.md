# telegram-logger

A simple Python script using Telethon to log all (or some) messages a user or bot account can see on Telegram.

# Requirements
* Python 3.6 or newer
* Python package dependencies: `poetry install` or `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* A Telegram user or bot account

# Usage
Set your `api_id` and `api_hash` in `config.toml`. You can get this from "API development tools" on <https://my.telegram.org/>. Note that this authenticates an app, not a user.

When you start the script for the first time, you will be prompted for credentials. Upon successful authentication, it will start logging all messages it can see to stdout.

You can set `enabled_chats` and `disabled_chats` in the config to a list of chat IDs to control which chats should be logged (the default is all).

You can set `log_to_file` to a filename you want to log to instead of stdout or in addition to it, depending on wether you set `log_stdout` to either `true` or `false` in the configuration.

If you use `cmd.exe` � A) congratulations on being boring and evil at the same time � and B) you might wanna use `log_colors` and set it to `false`, so that you can enjoy your logs.<br>This also goes for when you log to a file, since the stylings might not show properly anyway.
